- **Practical**: Real-world applications and constraints

## Why I Write

1. **Documentation**: Future me will thank present me for detailed notes
2. **Community**: Sharing knowledge helps everyone level up
3. **Learning**: Writing about problems deepens understanding
4. **Reference**: Building a searchable knowledge base
